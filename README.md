## EasyMorph Server .NET SDK

This library allows you to interact with EasyMorph Server from a .NET application.


**EasyMorph Server** runs on schedule projects created using desktop editions of EasyMorph (including the **free edition**). Project schedule and parameters are set up via Task properties. Every Task belongs to a Space. The Server has at least one Space named `Default`.


This document describes SDK which covers part of REST API v1 ( `http://[host:port]/api/v1/`). 


### EasyMorph Server API client
#### Dependencies:
* .NET framework version 4.5 or higher
* That's all

#### Download
The .NET SDK can be installed as a Nuget package from [ nuget EasyMorph.Server.SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EasyMorph.Server.SDK)

#### Introduction

To create an Api client, you have to provide the server host to the constructor:
``` C#
  using Morph.Server.Sdk.Client;
  ...
  var client = new MorphServerApiClient("http://192.168.1.1:6330");
```

All commands are async.
Every command  may raise an exception. You must take care to handle exceptions in a right way. EasyMorph Server SDK also has own exceptions, they are described in corresponding sections.

**Spaces**. Workspace is splitted into several Spaces. Each space has its own security restrictions. Space contains Tasks and Files.
There is at least one predefined space named `Default`. 

Space names are case-insensitive.

#### Sessions and Authorization
Accessing to any Space requires a valid session. There are two types of session: anonymous and real.
* *Anonymous* - just contain a Space name, isn't really opening. 
Anonymous session is valid to access spaces with no protection.
``` C#
var anonSession = ApiSession.Anonymous("some space");
```
* *Real session* - This session type is actually created at the Server when a user sends valid credentials. 
It is automatically renewed each time when you're accessing the Server with it.
Session is valid for a limited period of time and may be closed by inactivity or manually.


``` C#
//open session
var apiSession = await apiClient.OpenSessionAsync("space name", "password", cancellationToken);

try {
// do something...
}
finally {
//close session if it's no longer needed
await apiClient.CloseSessionAsync(apiSession,cancellationToken);
}
```

Another way:
```C#
using(var apiSession = await apiClient.OpenSessionAsync("space name", "password", cancellationToken)){
// do somethig...

}
```
Session opening requires some handshaking with the Server which is performed by a series of requests to the Server.

Passing wrong credentials will throw `MorphApiUnauthorizedException`. 

#### Spaces
##### List of all spaces
This anonymous method returns entire list of all spaces in a Server. 
``` C#
var spaces = await apiClient.GetSpacesListAsync(cancellationToken);
foreach(space in spaces){
///... 
}
```
##### Space status
Returns the current status of a space with permissions.
``` C#
var apiSession = ApiSession.Anonymous("Default");
var spaceStaus = await apiClient.GetSpaceStatusAsync(apiSession, cancellationToken);
```

#### Tasks
Accessing tasks requires a valid API session.

Assume that you have already created the task in space 'Default'. For these samples task id is `691ea42e-9e6b-438e-84d6-b743841c970e`.
Also assume, that you have read Sessions section and know how to open a session.

##### Tasks list

``` C#
  var apiSession = ApiSession.Anonymous("Default");

  var tasks = await client.GetTasksListAsync(apiSession, cancellationToken );
  foreach(var task in tasks){
  // do somethig with task
  }
```
If you want to get more details about a task (e.g. task parameters) use `GetTaskAsync` method.

##### Starting the Task

To run the task:

``` C#
  var apiSession = ApiSession.Anonymous("Default");
  var taskGuid = Guid.Parse("691ea42e-9e6b-438e-84d6-b743841c970e");
  await client.StartTaskAsync(apiSession, taskGuid , cancellationToken );
```
Caller gets control back immediately after the task initialized to start. If the task is already running, no exception is generated.


##### Stopping the Task

To stop the task
``` C#
  var apiSession = ApiSession.Anonymous("Default");
  var taskGuid = Guid.Parse("691ea42e-9e6b-438e-84d6-b743841c970e");
  await client.StopTaskAsync(apiSession, "691ea42e-9e6b-438e-84d6-b743841c970e", cancellationToken )
```
Caller gets control back immediately after the task is marked to stop.

#### Retrieving task info
Allow you to get task info (incl info about task parameters)
``` C#
try {
    var apiSession = ApiSession.Anonymous("Default");
    var taskGuid = Guid.Parse("691ea42e-9e6b-438e-84d6-b743841c970e");
    var status = await client.GetTaskAsync(apiSession, taskGuid, cancellationToken );
  
    var task = await _apiClient.GetTaskAsync(apiSession, parameters.TaskId.Value, _cancellationTokenSource.Token);
    Console.WriteLine("Info about task:");
    Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Id:'{0}'", task.Id));
    Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Name:'{0}'", task.TaskName));
    Console.WriteLine(string.Format("IsRunning:'{0}'", task.IsRunning));                
    Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Enabled:'{0}'", task.Enabled));
    Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Note:'{0}'", task.Note));
    Console.WriteLine(string.Format("ProjectPath:'{0}'", task.ProjectPath));
    Console.WriteLine(string.Format("StatusText:'{0}'", task.StatusText));
    Console.WriteLine(string.Format("TaskState:'{0}'", task.TaskState));
    Console.WriteLine("Task Parameters:");
    foreach (var parameter in task.TaskParameters)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Parameter '{parameter.Name}' = '{parameter.Value}' [{parameter.ParameterType}] (Note: {parameter.Note})");
    }
    Console.WriteLine("Done");
 
}catch(MorphApiNotFoundException notFound){
  Console.WriteLine("Task not found");
}

```


#### Retrieving task status 

You can check task state (running/ not running) by calling `GetTaskStatusAsync`

``` C#
try {
  var apiSession = ApiSession.Anonymous("Default");
  var taskGuid = Guid.Parse("691ea42e-9e6b-438e-84d6-b743841c970e");
  var status = await client.GetTaskStatusAsync(apiSession, taskGuid, cancellationToken );
  if(status.IsRunning){
    Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Task {0} is running", status.TaskName));
  }
}catch(MorphApiNotFoundException notFound){
  Console.WriteLine("Task not found");
}

```

#### Files API

EasyMorph Server allows accessing files of a space remotely. 


##### Browsing files
To browse files and folders use `BrowseSpaceAsync`.


``` C#
public sealed class SpaceBrowsingInfo
  {
        public ulong FreeSpaceBytes { get; set; }
        public string SpaceName { get; set; }
        public WebFilesAccesMode WebFilesAccesMode { get; set; }

        public List<SpaceFolderInfo> Folders { get; set; }        
        public List<SpaceFileInfo> Files { get; set; }
        public List<SpaceNavigation> NavigationChain { get; set; }
        
        ...
  }

public async Task<SpaceBrowsingInfo> BrowseSpaceAsync(string spaceName, string folderPath, CancellationToken cancellationToken);


```

* `Folder` and `Files` contain the content for requested `folderPath` in Space `spaceName`.
* `WebFilesAccesMode` shows restrictions for files in Space. You can check permissions before trying to upload or download files.



Consider, that there is Folder 1 in space Default. *Folder 1* has nested Folder 2.
So to browse Folder 2 you can call:

``` C#
  var apiSession = ApiSession.Anonymous("Default");  
  var listing = await client.BrowseSpaceAsync(apiSession, "Folder 1/Folder 2",cancellationToken);
```


##### Upload file
For showing progress state changes while large files that are uploading/downloading, you might want to subscribe to the `FileProgress` event.

To upload a file call `UploadFileAsync`. It consumes data directly from the stream. There is also an overloaded version, which requires a file name.

``` C#
var apiSession = ApiSession.Anonymous("Default");  
await _apiClient.UploadFileAsync(apiSession, @"D:\data\file.xml", @"\folder 2", cancellationToken, overwriteFileifExists:false);
```

By default, this method WILL NOT overwrite file if it already exists. In such case, an exception will be raised.


Please consider that currently such kind of errors (file already exists, folder not found) are generated only AFTER entire request was sent to server. 

It will be a good approach to check if a file/folder exists and you have appropriate permissions before sending huge files over a slow Internet connection. To do this, use `SpaceBrowseAsync`, `FileExistsAsync`.


##### Download file
For showing progress state changes while a large file is uploading/downloading, you might want to subscribe to `FileProgress` event.
Download file:

``` C#
var apiSession = ApiSession.Anonymous("Default");  
using (Stream streamToWriteTo = File.Open(tempFile, FileMode.Create)) 
{
        let fileInfo  = await DownloadFileAsync(apiSession, @"\server\folder\file.xml", streamToWriteTo, cancellationToken);        
        Console.WriteLine("File " + fileInfo.FileName + "downloaded into " + tempFile);
}
                  
                    
```
##### Check the existence of file

You can check that a file exists by using `BrowseSpaceAsync`:
``` C#
  var apiSession = ApiSession.Anonymous("Default"); 
  var listing = await client.BrowseSpaceAsync(apiSession, "Folder 1/Folder 2",cancellationToken);
  // check that file somefile.txt exists in Folder 1/Folder 2
  if(listing.FileExists("somefile.txt"))
  {
     // do something...
  }
```



##### File deletion


``` C#
var apiSession = ApiSession.Anonymous("Default"); 
await DeleteFileAsync(apiSession, @"\server\folder", "file.xml", cancellationToken);

```



#### Commands

##### Task Validation
You can check tasks for missing parameters. 
E.g a task has parameters that the project (used by the task) doesn't contain. It is useful to call this method right after the project has been uploaded to the Server.

For now, there is no way to validate a project *before* upload.

``` C# 
var apiSession = ApiSession.Anonymous("Default"); 
ValidateTasksResult result = await ValidateTasksAsync(apiSession, @"folder 2\project.morph" , cancellationToken);
if(result.FailedTasks.Count !=0 ){
     Console.WriteInfo("Some tasks have errors");
     foreach (var item in result.FailedTasks)
     {
        Console.WriteInfo(item.TaskId + ": " + item.Message + "@" + item.TaskApiUrl);
     }
}
```

### Exceptions
Morph.Server.SDK may raise own exceptions like `MorphApiNotFoundException` if a resource not found, or `ParseResponseException` if it is not possible to parse server response.
A full list of exceptions can be found in `Morph.Server.Sdk.Exceptions` namespace.

### SSL
We advise you to use SSL with EasyMorph Server with a trusted SSL certificate.  

If you want to use a self-signed certificate, you need to handle this situation in your code. 

In such case you should to setup a validation callback:  https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.servicepointmanager.servercertificatevalidationcallback

One of the possible solutions can be found at the stackoverflow:  https://stackoverflow.com/a/526803/692329

**disclaimer:**  use any kind of the self-signed certificates and security policy suppression are at your own risk. We highly DO NOT RECOMMEND doing this.
